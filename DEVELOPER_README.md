Home Screen
- As we do not have home screen psd, we have used the received image on the home screen and overlapped button on it.

Post Detail Screen
- As we do not receive any field to display detail description from the given API (https://api.reddit.com/r/pics/hot.json) , we have displayed SelfText Value received from API at the place of description

Profile Screen
- We do not have Profile screen psd, so we have used static images as profile and cover image

Please also accept that due to the time constraint the code is not been tested on the actual devices it is only tested on the simulator.
